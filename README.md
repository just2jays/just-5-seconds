# Why?
This is a simple game I've been building to develop my [React](https://reactjs.org/) skills, learn more about the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) style framework, and build a functioning [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

# How does it work?
The rules of the game are simple. Stop the clock as close as you can to 0.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
