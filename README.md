## What is this?
This is a simple game I've been building to develop my [React](https://reactjs.org/) skills, learn more about the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) style framework, and build a functioning [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

## OK, so how does it work?
The rules of the game are simple. Stop the clock as close as you can to 0.

...that's it...I told you it was simple!
